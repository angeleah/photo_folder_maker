Photo Folder Maker
==================
This command line app creates a directory structure for me to organize my model photography based on a model name and their set name.  It was created to help me DRY up my import and sorting process after shoots.

At this point, this app is hard coded to work with my set up so there is not much for you to do.  It takes a model name and a set name and creates folders based on those.
